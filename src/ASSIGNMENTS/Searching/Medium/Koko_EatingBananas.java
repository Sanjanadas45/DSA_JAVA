//Koko Eating Bananas
//Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
//Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k.
// Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile.
// If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
//Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
//Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

package ASSIGNMENTS.Searching.Medium;
import java.util.Arrays;

//Approach
//Use binary search to minimize K.
//        For each K, check if Koko can finish all bananas in H hours.
//        If she can, try a smaller K.
//        If she canâ€™t, increase K.
